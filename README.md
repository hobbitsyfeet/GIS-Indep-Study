# UofLStudy
This is the github repository for Justin Petluk's Independent study at University of Lethbridge. (2019)

This program will use a modified Tracktor to create a semi-automatic processing tool to track individuals in the video.
This program extends this tracking and maps the pixel coordinates to GPS locations when used in a remote-sensing manner.
More details will be released in the future.
